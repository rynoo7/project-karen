🧠 Karen: Your Interactive Garage AI

Welcome to Karen, a quirky, curious, and ever-evolving Raspberry Pi-powered assistant who lives inside your garage — complete with memory, vision, and personality. This project blends ambient storytelling, computer vision, user interfaces, and a sci-fi aesthetic to bring Karen to life.
🚀 What is Karen?

Karen is a personal AI system designed to run on Raspberry Pi with a fully immersive interface. She’s not just smart — she’s interactive. From recognizing physical tools and areas of your garage, to displaying memory snapshots and learning user behavior, Karen’s goal is to feel alive and personalized to your space.
🧰 Core Features

    🗺️ Garage Mapping UI — Visual tool for selecting and labeling physical garage zones

    🎥 Snapshot Memory System — Auto-records activity and archives photos and videos

    🤖 Pygame UI — Fullscreen display with scrollable panoramic environments

    🔍 Object Recognition (Coming Soon) — Real-time tracking of garage tools

    🧠 Memory Core — Dynamic zone logic and internal tool states

🧪 Experimental Design Goals

    Responsive AI character with memory-based interactions

    Layered zones and subzones that simulate real garage layouts

    Developer-friendly modularity for easy feature swapping

    Long-term data tracking for future machine learning integrations

📝 Collaboration Rules

    Make a new script inside core/experimental/ before adding to main/

    Record all significant changes in VERSIONS.md (root folder)

    Use comments liberally — Karen's code should always be human-readable

    Try to be funny, but not too funny. She’s sensitive.
