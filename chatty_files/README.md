# Chatty Files â€“ Temporary AI Transfer Zone

This folder is used for temporary file staging during collaboration with AI systems like ChatGPT.

It may occasionally store:
- Zip files of project folders for remote diffing or comparison
- Text outputs for side-by-side inspection
- Any files used for short-term back-and-forth during development

This folder should **never** contain production code or final assets. 
It can be safely emptied after each session.

> If you're reading this, we probably just sent some cool stuff to our AI buddy.
 
- I'm using this as my README demo
