# 📁 Karen Assets Directory

This folder houses all non-code media files used by Karen’s interface and backend systems.

## Structure

- `Calibration/` – Camera calibration frames for aligning physical/virtual mapping
- `Photos/` – Reference images and static UI media
- `Recordings/` – Archived video/audio logs from memory and interactions
- `snapshots/` – Automated screencaptures generated by Karen’s vision module

These files are organized for fast access, replay, and future machine learning upgrades.
