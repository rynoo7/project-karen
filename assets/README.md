# Karen Assets

This folder contains all media assets used by Karen for her interface, memory, and sensor calibration. These are essential for building her visual memory, rendering the garage UI, and creating immersive interactions.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `Calibration/` – Reference images used to calibrate camera positions and scene scaling.
- `Photos/` – Still images of key garage features and reference items.
- `Recordings/` – Captured video or audio logs from Karen's memory system.
- `snapshots/` – Automatically saved frames or images from live sessions.

---

## 📌 Guidelines

- **Do not edit original assets directly.** Create a copy or new version if you need to modify something.
- Add new photos or media only when they are integrated into a feature or zone system.
- Always compress large media when possible.
- Use descriptive filenames and timestamps.

## 💡 Tips for Developers

- The panoramic image `GARAGE.jpg` is currently used by the garage UI to render the full-screen display.
- Karen uses webcam snapshots in `snapshots/` to record moments of activity or analysis.
- All assets are expected to be referenced via relative paths in code.

Happy building! Every snapshot is another piece of Karen's evolving memory.
